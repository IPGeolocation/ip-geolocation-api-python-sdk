> List[GetBulkIpSecurityInfoResponse] get_bulk_ip_security_info(get_bulk_ip_geolocation_request, include=include, fields=fields, excludes=excludes, output=output, lang=lang)

The Bulk IP Security Lookup API can provide security details for up to `50,000` bulk IPs. This API also has parameters to customize the response, just like the single IP Security Lookup API.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (ApiKeyAuth):

```python
import ipgeolocation
from ipgeolocation.models.get_bulk_ip_geolocation_request import GetBulkIpGeolocationRequest
from ipgeolocation.models.get_bulk_ip_security_info_response import GetBulkIpSecurityInfoResponse
from ipgeolocation.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ipgeolocation.io/v2
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = ipgeolocation.Configuration(
    host="https://api.ipgeolocation.io/v2"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKeyAuth
configuration.api_key['ApiKeyAuth'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['ApiKeyAuth'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ipgeolocation.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = ipgeolocation.IPSecurityApi(api_client)
    get_bulk_ip_geolocation_request = ipgeolocation.GetBulkIpGeolocationRequest()  # GetBulkIpGeolocationRequest | 
    include = 'location,network,currency,time_zone,user_agent,country_metadata,hostname'  # str | Include optional objects like `location`, `network`.  Use comma-separated values. Example: include=location,network  (optional)
    fields = 'security.is_tor, location,'  # str | Get specific fields, objects from the response. (optional)
    excludes = 'security.is_cloud_provider'  # str | Exclude specific fields, objects from the response. (optional)
    output = 'json'  # str | Desired output format. (optional)
    lang = 'en'  # str | By default, the API responds in English. You can change the response language by passing the language code as a query parameter `lang`. Multi language feature is available only for `paid users`. (optional)

    try:
        api_response = api_instance.get_bulk_ip_security_info(get_bulk_ip_geolocation_request, include=include,
                                                              fields=fields, excludes=excludes, output=output,
                                                              lang=lang)
        print("The response of IPSecurityApi->get_bulk_ip_security_info:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling IPSecurityApi->get_bulk_ip_security_info: %s\n" % e)
```

# **get_ip_security_info**
> IPSecurityAPIResponse get_ip_security_info(ip=ip, include=include, fields=fields, excludes=excludes, output=output, lang=lang)

IP Security API provides security details of a given IP. It detects whether the IP is proxy, tor or bot. It also shows the proxy types of the IP (like VPN, PROXY, RELAY etc.) with it's VPN/proxy service provider making our API powerful VPN checker. It finds the IPs that are involved in spam activities. It also checks whether the IP links to a cloud provider and includes the provider's name.
